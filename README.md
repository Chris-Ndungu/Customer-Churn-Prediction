## Problem Statement
Telecommunication companies provide services such as phone services, internet services, streaming service, etc. 
However, this telco company has been experiencing a high rate of churning of its customers. 

## Solution

The project uses Random Forest Classifier as a classification model to predict the contributors of customer churning in a telcom company and their levels of impact.
